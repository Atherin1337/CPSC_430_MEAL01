Assuming we still have XAMPP installed from 350:

Drop the MEALZ.sql in the:
C:\xammp\mysql\bin folder.

Then source the file by:
Starting XAMPP!  /facepalm.  2 hours man.   TWO HOURS!!! 
-open a command prompt
-type:  cd c:\xampp\mysql\bin
-type:  mysql -u root                  "Assuming you never set a password"
should get the mysql prompt:

type:  source mealz.sql

That should do it.

Then the project should be executable.
